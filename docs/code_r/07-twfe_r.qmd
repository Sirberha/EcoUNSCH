## The classic 2x2 DiD or the Twoway Fixed Effects Model (TWFE)

Let us start with the classic Twoway Fixed Effects (TWFE) model:

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Treat_i + \beta_2 Post_t + \beta_3 Treat_i Post_t + \epsilon_{it}  $$


The above two by two (2x2) model can be explained using the following table:


|  | Treatment = 0 | Treatment = 1 | *Difference*  | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -----   |
| **Post = 0** |  $$ \beta_0 $$   | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 $$    |  $$ \beta_1 $$  |
| **Post = 1** |  $$\beta_0 + \beta_2 $$   |  $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 $$  |  $$ \beta_1 + \beta_3 $$   |
| Difference | $$ \beta_2 $$   |  $$ \beta_2 + \beta_3 $$  | $$ \beta_3 $$   |

## The triple difference estimator (DDD)

*incomplete*

The triple difference estimator essential takes two DDs, one with the target unit of analysis with a treated and an untreated group. This is compared to another similar group in the pre and post-treatment period. Fo effectively there are two treatments. One where an actual treatment on the desired group is tested, and a placebo comparison group, on which the same intervention is also applied.

$$ y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 P_{i} + \beta_2 C_{j} + \beta_3 T_t + \beta_4 (P_i T_t) + \beta_5 (C_j T_t) + \beta_6 (P_i C_j) + \beta_7 (P_i C_j T_t) + \epsilon_{it} $$

where we have 3x3 combinations: $P = {0,1}$, $T={0,1}$, $C={0,1}$. As is the case with the 2x2 DD, here the coefficient of interest is $\beta_7$. This can also be broken down in a table form. But rather than create one big table, the results are usually presented for C = 0, or the main treatment group, and for C = 1, or the main comparison group. The difference between the two boils down to $\beta_7$. Let's see this here:


Main group ($C = 0$):


|          | T = 0 | T = 1 | Difference  | 
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -----   |
| **P = 0** | $$ \beta_0 $$  | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_3 $$   | $$ \beta_3 $$ |
| **P = 1** | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 $$ | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_3 + \beta_4 $$  | $$ \beta_3 + \beta_4 $$  |
| Difference | $$ \beta_1 $$  | $$ \beta_1 + \beta_4 $$  | $$ \beta_4 $$  |

Comparison group ($C = 1$):

|          | T = 0 | T = 1 | Difference | 
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -----   |
| **P = 0** | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_2 $$  | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 + \beta_5  $$  | $$ \beta_3 + \beta_5 $$  |
| **P = 1** | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_6  $$ | $$ \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 + \beta_4 + \beta_5 + \beta_6 + \beta_7 $$  | $$ \beta_3 + \beta_4 + \beta_5 + \beta_7  $$ |
| Difference | $$ \beta_1 + \beta_6  $$  | $$ \beta_1 + \beta_4 + \beta_6 + \beta_7 $$ | $$ \beta_4 + \beta_7 $$  |


Let's take the difference between the two matrices or $(C = 1) - (C = 0)$:


|          | T = 0 | T = 1 | Difference  | 
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -----   |
| **P = 0** | $$ \beta_2  $$ | $$ \beta_2 + \beta_5 $$   |  $$ \beta_5 $$ |
| **P = 1** | $$ \beta_2 + \beta_6 $$ | $$ \beta_2 + \beta_5 + \beta_6 + \beta_7 $$ | $$ \beta_6 + \beta_7 $$  |
| Difference |  $$ \beta_6 $$   | $$ \beta_6 + \beta_7 $$ | $$ \beta_7 $$   |

where we end up with the main difference of $$ \beta_7 $$. Note that this table logic is also far simpler than having a long list of expectations defined for each combination.

## The generic TWFE functional form

If we have multiple time periods and treatment units, the classic 2x2 DiD can be extended to the following generic functional form:

$$ y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \alpha_t + \beta^{TWFE} D_{it} + \epsilon_{it} $$

## R Code

It's not strictly necessary---we could implement all of the coding examples on
this page using only base R---but we'll use the **ggplot2** and **fixest**
packages to help demonstrate some core principles of TWFE.

```{r twfe_R_pkgs}
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "fixest"))
library(ggplot2)
library(fixest)

# Optional: ggplot2 theme
theme_set(
    theme_linedraw() +
    theme(
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(linetype = 3, linewidth = 0.1),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = 3, linewidth = 0.1)
    )
)
```

Let us generate a simple 2x2 example in R. First step define the panel
structure. Since it is a 2x2, we just need two units and two time periods:

```{r}
dat = data.frame(
    id = rep(1L:2L, times = 2),
    tt = rep(1L:2L, each = 2)
)
```

Next we define the treatment group and a generic TWFE model without adding any
variation or error terms:

```{r}
dat = dat |>
    within({
        D     = id == 2 & tt == 2
        btrue = ifelse(D, 2, 0)
        y     = id + 3 * tt + btrue * D
    })

dat
```

According to the last line, the treatment effect should have an impact of 3
units on Y in the post group. We can check this by plotting the data:

```{r twfe1_R}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = tt, y = y, col = factor(id))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1.5, lty = 2) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:2, labels = c("Pre", "Post")) +
    labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Outcome variable", col = "ID")
```

where we can see that the difference between the blue and the orange line is 3
in the post period, and 1 in the pre-period, making it a net gain of 2 units.
Which also equals the treatment amount we specified.

We can also recover this from a simple panel regression:
```{r}
coef(lm(y ~ D + factor(id) + tt, dat))["DTRUE"]
```

In the regression, you will see that the coefficient on D(=TRUE), $\beta^{TWFE} = 2$,
as expected. An alternative way of doing this is to use `fixest::feols`,
which we will also call in later examples:

```{r}
# library(fixest) ## Already loaded

coef(feols(y ~ D | id + tt, dat))
```

which again gives us the expected result of 2 for the `DTRUE` coefficient.

## Adding more time periods

Now that we are comfortable with the 2x2 example, let's add more time periods.
How about 10 per unit:

```{r}
dat2 = data.frame(
    id = rep(1:2, times = 10),
    tt = rep(1:10, each = 2)
)
```

Now imagine that there is a positive treatment shock of 3 units at time period 5
for individual no. 2, which remains for the duration of the experiment.

```{r}
dat2 = dat2 |>
    within({
        D     = id == 2 & tt >= 5
        btrue = ifelse(D, 3, 0)
        y     = id + 1 * tt + btrue * D
    })
```

We can also visualize this as follows:

```{r twfe2_R}
ggplot(dat2, aes(x = tt, y = y, col = factor(id))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 4.5, lty = 2) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
    labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Outcome variable", col = "ID")
```

and we can also run the TWFE regression:

```{r}
# lm(y ~ D + factor(id) + tt, dat2) # same result as below
feols(y ~ D | id + tt, dat2)
```

Again, this yields the expected treatment effect (this time:
$\beta^{TWFE} = 3$).

## More units, same treatment time, different treatment effects

Next, let's consider a simple extension where we add a second treatment unit
(still keeping a single control group). For now we'll specify that both treated
units receive treatment simultaneously, although the intensity of the treatment
effect varies. Specifically, we'll assume that id=2 has a treatment effect of 2,
whereas id=3 has a treatment effect of 4. We therefore know ahead of time that
the ATT is thus 3 (i.e., average of the individual treatment effects). Here's
the R code for constructing the dataset:

```{r}
dat3 = data.frame(
    id = rep(1:3, times = 10),
    tt = rep(1:10, each = 3)
    ) |>
    within({
        D     = id >= 2 & tt >= 5
        btrue = ifelse(D & id == 3, 4, ifelse(D & id == 2, 2, 0))
        y     = id + 1 * tt + btrue * D
    })
```

Plot it:

```{r twfe3_R}
ggplot(dat3, aes(x = tt, y = y, col = factor(id))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 4.5, lty = 2) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
    labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Outcome variable", col = "ID")
```

While the trending data series make it a little trickier to see directly, we can
again turn to our simple TWFE regression model to confirm that our ATT is
$\beta^{TWFE}=3$.

```{r}
feols(y ~ D | id + tt, dat3)
```

It's worth noting that our TWFE regression specification satisifies the parallel trends assumption for this simulated example. One way to make this even more explicit by estimating slightly different specifications that drop (include) different combinations of the unit and time fixed effects. Here we'll use **fixest**'s nifty [stepwise](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/stepwise.html) functionality to estimate all combinations of time and unit fixed effects in a single function call.

```{r}
# mvsw yields multiverse stepwise combinations
feols(y ~ D | mvsw(tt, id), dat3) |>
    etable(vcov = "iid")
```

The above table makes clear that only the final specification (4th column) that controls for
both unit and time fixed effects yields the correct ATT of 3.

## More units, differential treatment time, different treatment effects

Finally, let us consider how things change when we introduce treatment with
differential timing. As we'll see, this is where the simple logic of TWFE starts
to break down.

Start with a new simulated dataset, with differential timing for our two treated
units:

```{r}
dat4 = data.frame(
    id = rep(1:3, times = 10),
    tt = rep(1:10, each = 3)
    ) |>
    within({
        D     = (id == 2 & tt >= 5) | (id == 3 & tt >= 8)
        btrue = ifelse(D & id == 3, 4, ifelse(D & id == 2, 2, 0))
        y     = id + 1 * tt + btrue * D
    })
```

In plot form:

```{r twfe4_R}
ggplot(dat4, aes(x = tt, y = y, col = factor(id))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(4.5, 7.5), lty = 2) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
    labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Outcome variable", col = "ID")
```

The figure shows that the group id=2 gets the intervention at t=5 and stays treated, while the group id=3 gets the intervention at 
t=8 and stays treated. So what is the ATT here?

Unlike the previous examples, were we could derive the ATT, just by looking at
the graph, it is not so trivial here. The staggered treatment timing introduces
new confounding factors above the simple unit and time fixed effects. (Note that
this would be true even if the trend lines weren't sloping upwards.) Without
going into the maths, to recover the actual ATT, we need to average out time and
panel effects for treated and non-treated observations. What does our TWFE
regression give us?

```{r}
feols(y ~ D | tt + id, dat4)
```

Here, we obtain a coefficient of $\beta^{TWFE} = 2.91$. Can we really call this
estimate the ATT? Let's think about what number represents. We have two
treatments happening at different times with different treatment effects.
Therefore the definition of "pre" and "post" is not clear anymore. Neither is
"untreated" versus "treated". If zoom in on the interval $5\leq t < 8$, then only
id=2 has received a treatment bump, while the other two units are continuing at a constant rate. But in the last
interval $t \geq 8$ only id=3 is receiving a treatment effect, while the
other two panel variables are constant in this interval (even through id=2 has already been treated!)

Fully disentangling these combinations will take some more careful work, which
why we defer to the next section on
[Bacon decomposition](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code_r/07_bacon/).

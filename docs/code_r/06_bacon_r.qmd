This section will walk you through the basic logic of Andrew Goodman-Bacon's
TWFE decomposition. It draws upon his 2021 _Journal of Econometrics paper_,  
[Difference-in-differences with variation in treatment timing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621001445).

We'll make use of the following R packages.

```{r}
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "fixest", "bacondecomp"))
library(ggplot2)
library(fixest)
library(bacondecomp)

# Optional: custom ggplot2 theme
theme_set(
    theme_linedraw() +
    theme(
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(linetype = 3, linewidth = 0.1),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = 3, linewidth = 0.1)
    )
)
```

## What is the Goodman-Bacon decomposition?

As discussed at the end of the TWFE section, the introduction of differential
treatment timing makes it hard to draw a bright line between _pre_ and _post_
treatment periods. Let's continue with the same dataset that we were using in
the final example from that section.

```{r}
dat4 = data.frame(
    id = rep(1:3, times = 10),
    tt = rep(1:10, each = 3)
    ) |>
    within({
        D = (id == 2 & tt >= 5) | (id == 3 & tt >= 8)
        btrue = ifelse(D & id == 3, 4, ifelse(D & id == 2, 2, 0))
        y = id + 1 * tt + btrue * D
    })
```

In plot form:

```{r bacon1}
ggplot(dat4, aes(x = tt, y = y, col = factor(id))) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(4.5, 7.5), lty = 2) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
    labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Outcome variable", col = "ID")
```

Here we see that our simulation includes two distinct treatment periods. The
first treatment occurs to period 5, where id=2's trendline jumps by 2 units. The
second treatment occurs in  period 8, where id=3's trendline jumps by 4 units.
In contrast, id=1 remains untreated for the duration of the experiment.

Stepping back, it's not immediately clear how to calculate the ATT. For example,
how should the late treated unit (id=3) regard the early treated unit (id=2)?
Can the latter be used as control group for the former? After all, they didn't
receive treatment at the same time... but, on the other hand, id=2's path was
already altered by the initial treatment wave.

To unravel this conundrum, let's start by estimating a simple TWFE model.

```{r}
feols(y ~ D | id + tt, dat4)
```

What does the resulting coefficient estimate of $\hat{\beta}=2.91$ 
represent? The short answer is that it comprises a _weighted average_ of four
distinct 2x2 groups (or comparisons): 

1. **treated** vs **untreated**
	1) _early treated ($T^e$)_ vs _untreated ($U$)_
	2) _late treated ($T^l$)_ vs _untreated ($U$)_
2. **differentially treated**
	1) _early treated ($T^e$)_ vs _late control ($C^l$)_
	2) _late treated ($T^l$)_ vs _early control ($C^e$)_

We can visualize these four comparison sets as follows:

```{r bacon2}
rbind(
	dat4 |> subset(id %in% c(1,2)) |> transform(role = ifelse(id==2, "Treatment", "Control"), comp = "1.1. Early vs Untreated"),
	dat4 |> subset(id %in% c(1,3)) |> transform(role = ifelse(id==3, "Treatment", "Control"), comp = "1.2. Late vs Untreated"),
	dat4 |> subset(id %in% c(2,3) & tt<8) |> transform(role = ifelse(id==2, "Treatment", "Control"), comp = "2.1. Early vs Untreated"),
	dat4 |> subset(id %in% c(2:3) & tt>4) |> transform(role = ifelse(id==3, "Treatment", "Control"), comp = "2.2. Late vs Untreated")
) |>
	ggplot(aes(tt, y, group = id, col = factor(id), lty = role)) +
	geom_point() + geom_line() + 
	facet_wrap(~comp) +
	scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) +
	scale_linetype_manual(values = c("Control" = 5, "Treatment" = 1)) +
	labs(x = "Time variable", y = "Ouroleome variable", col = "ID", lty = "Role")
```

In other words, the panel IDs are split into different timing cohorts based on
when the first treatment takes place and where it lies in relation to the
treatment of other panel IDs. The more panel IDs and differential treatment
timings there are, the more the combinations of the above groups.

The Goodman-Bacon decomposition isolates each of these 2x2 comparisons and
assigns them a weight, based on their relative coverage in the data (i.e., how
long each comparison lasts relative to the overall timespan, and how many units
were involved).

To implement the Goodman-Bacon decomposition in R, we need simply call the
`bacon()` function from the **bacondecomp** package. An introductory vignette to
package is available
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bacondecomp/vignettes/bacon.html),
although the arguments are pretty self-explanatory. Let's see what it yields
for our present problem:

```{r}
(bgd = bacon(y ~ D, dat4, id_var = "id", time_var = "tt"))
```

Here we get our weights and the 2x2 $\beta$ for each group. The table tells us that ($T$ vs $U$), which is the sum of the late and early treated versus never treated, has the largest weight, followed by early vs late treated, and lastly, late vs early treated.

Importantly, note that the weighted mean of these estimates is exactly the same
as our earlier (naive) TWFE coefficient estimate. Again, this shouldn't be
surprising, since the whole point of the Bacon-Goodman exercise is to decompose
the makeup of that estimate and thus highlight potential sources of bias.

```{r}
(bgd_wm = weighted.mean(bgd$estimate, bgd$weight))
```

We can easily plot this result to visualize how the different components are
affecting the overall estimate.

```{r bacon3}
ggplot(bgd, aes(x = weight, y = estimate, shape = type, col = type)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = bgd_wm, lty  = 2) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(
	x = "Weight", y = "Estimate", shape = "Type", col = "Type",
	title = "Bacon-Goodman decomposition example",
	caption = "Note: The horizontal dotted line depicts the full TWFE estimate."
	)
```

The figure shows four points for the four groups in our example.

- _Earlier vs Later Treated_ (red circle).
- _Later vs Earlier Treated_ (green triangle).
- _Treated vs Untreated_ (two blue squares; one for the earlier treated group and another for the later treated group).

Finally, Note that the estimate values of 2 and 4 coincide with the treatment
effects that were encoded into our simulation. Specifically, unit id=2 increases
by 2 and unit id=3 increases by 4 over the untreated unit id=1.

## So where do TWFE regressions go wrong?

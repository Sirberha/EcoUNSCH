## Introduction

Among (many) other things, 
[Laurent BergÃ©'s](https://sites.google.com/site/laurentrberge/)
[**fixest**](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/) package supports the estimation
procedure described by the Sun and Abraham 2020 paper [Estimating Dynamic
Treatment Effects in Event Studies with Heterogeneous Treatment
Effects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440762030378X)
(hereafter SA20).  The key function is 
**[`sunab()`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/sunab.html)**,
which provides equivalent
functionality to the `eventstudyinteract` Stata command. However, it requires
less manual tuning (e.g., leads and lags are detected automatically) and it 
integrates natively with **fixest's** other facilities (e.g. graphing and
tabling). As one would expect of **fixest**, estimation is also very fast---you
will likely find it to be the fastest option among all of the specialist DiD
libraries that we cover here. These features combine to make it an attractive
and natural option for staggered DiD settings.

## Installation and options

The package can be installed from CRAN.

```r
install.packages("fixest") # Install (only need to run once or when updating)
library("fixest")          # Load the package into memory (required each new session)
```

The key function for implementing the SA20 aggregation procedure is `sunab()`.
This serves as an internal argument for the `fixest::feols()` function that
many users will be familiar with for estimating (high-dimensional fixed-effect)
regressions. The most basic form is thus:

```r
feols(y ~ sunab(cohort, period) | id + period, data, ...)
```

where

| Variable | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| y | outcome variable |
| cohort | variable describing a common treatment period (e.g., `year_treated`) |
| period | time variable  |
| id | panel id |
| ... | Additional arguments |

All of the regular `feols()` functionality and post-estimation options can be
layered on top of the basic case above. For example, users can add covariates, 
change the default cohort reference (here: the never-treated), etc. It's even
possible to integrate `sunab()` into **fixest's** nonlinear model estimators
like `feglm()` and `fepois()`, although I don't believe these have good 
theoretical support. See the helpfile
([`?sunab`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/sunab.html))
for more detailed information, as well as the
[introductory vignette](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/articles/fixest_walkthrough.html#staggered-difference-in-differences-sun-and-abraham-2020).

## Dataset

To demonstrate the package in action, we'll use the fake dataset that we 
[created earlier]({{ "/docs/code_r#data-generation" | relative_url }}). Here's a 
reminder of what the data look like.

```r
head(dat)
#>   time id        y rel_time treat first_treat
#> 1    1  1 2.158289      -11 FALSE          12
#> 2    2  1 2.498052      -10 FALSE          12
#> 3    3  1 3.034077       -9 FALSE          12
#> 4    4  1 4.886266       -8 FALSE          12
#> 5    5  1 7.085950       -7 FALSE          12
#> 6    6  1 5.788352       -6 FALSE          12
```

Or, in graph form.

## Test the package

Remember to load the package (if you haven't already).

```r
library(fixest)
```

Let's try the basic `sunab()` function (as integrated inside `feols()`). Note 
that we don't have any covariates, although these would be trivial to add to the
model formula. Similarly, we'll explicitly cluster the standard errors by
individual ID, although this is redundant since **fixest** automatically
clusters by the first variable in the fixed-effect slot. This next code chunk
should complete almost instaneously.

```r
sa20 = feols(
    y ~ sunab(first_treat, rel_time) | id + time, 
    data = dat, vcov = ~id
    )
sa20

```

Being a **fixest** model, all of the usual methods apply to our `sa20` object.
For example, we can export the regression table to LaTeX with
[`etable()`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/etable.html), or
visualize the event-study with
[`iplot()`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/coefplot.html#iplot-1).
Here I'll do the latter, using a bit of regex to drop leads and lags with 2
digits (i.e., dropping everything greater than 9 periods away from treatment).
This isn't strictly necessary, but will sharpen up our focus on the periods
around the treatment date.

```r
# iplot(sa20)
# Vanilla option (above) is fine, but we can tweak a bit...
sa20 |>
  iplot(
    main     = "fixest::sunab",
    xlab     = "Time to treatment",
    drop     = "[[:digit:]]{2}",    # Limit lead and lag periods to -9:9
    ref.line = 1
    )
```

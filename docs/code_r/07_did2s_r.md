## Introduction

The [**did2s**](https://kylebutts.com/did2s) R package by [Kyle
Butts](https://kylebutts.com/) implements the method proposed by the Gardner
2021 paper 
[Two-stage differences in differences](https://jrgcmu.github.io/2sdd_current.pdf). 
A detailed description is provided on the **did2s**
[website](https://kylebutts.com/did2s/articles/Two-Stage-Difference-in-Differences.html).

The key idea behind **did2s** is pretty simple and is clever implementation of the
[Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL)](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fwl-theorem-or-how-to-make-all-regressions-intuitive-59f801eb3299) 
theorem that should be familiar to many readers. In short, we can avoid the
pathologies of staggered DiD settings by running two regressions (hence the name): 

  1. Run a fixed-effects regression (including controls) on our outcome variable using only the untreated/not-yet-treated observations. Residualize the outcomes (i.e., subtract the predicted outcomes from the actual outcomes).
  2. Regress the residualized outcomes on the treatment dummies (or, time-to-treament dummies for an event study) using all obsevations to get the unbiased treatment effects.

A virtue of this two-step procedure is that it is very quick to estimate.
Underneath the hood, **did2s** calls
[**fixest**](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/), so all of the associated
methods of the latter package are available (tabling, plotting, etc.). More
importantly, it shares some syntax shortcuts/conventions that we should use for
specifying our models. We'll see some examples of this below.

Before continuing, it is worth noting that the **did2s** package also provides
convenience functions for 
[running and visualizing a range of DiD estimators](https://kylebutts.com/did2s/articles/event_study.html)
(i.e., not just the method proposed by Gardner 2021). This makes it a very
useful package to have in the applied econometrican's R toolkit. We'll save this
functionality for the "All estimators" section, though. _STILL NEED TO ADD THIS._

## Installation and options

The package can be installed from CRAN.

```r
install.packages("did2s") # Install (only need to run once or when updating)
library("did2s")          # Load the package into memory (required each new session)
```

The core estimating function is `did2s()` and it takes the following arguments:

```r
did2s(data, yname, treatment, first_stage, second_stage, ...)
```

where

| Variable | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| data | dataset |
| yname | outcome variable (character) |
| first_stage | 1st-stage regression forumula (controls & FEs) |
| second_stage | 2nd-stage regression formula (treatment indicator)  |
| treatment | treatment dummy variable (character) |
| cluster_var | how to cluster SEs (character) |
| ... | Additional arguments (bootstrapping, etc.) |

As mentioned above, **did2s** calls **fixest** underneath the hood and so
expects some the syntax conventions and shortcuts offered by the latter.  The
most obvious cases are the use of the `|` fixed-effect slot in `first_stage`
formula, and the use of `i()` in the `second_stage` formula. We'll illustrate
this directly with an example below. But you can take a look at the helpfile
([`?did2s`](https://kylebutts.com/did2s/reference/did2s.html)) for detailed information and additional examples.

## Dataset

To demonstrate the package in action, we'll use the fake dataset that we 
[created earlier]({{ "/docs/code_r#data-generation" | relative_url }}). Here's a 
reminder of what the data look like.

```r
head(dat)
#>   time id        y rel_time treat first_treat
#> 1    1  1 2.158289      -11 FALSE          12
#> 2    2  1 2.498052      -10 FALSE          12
#> 3    3  1 3.034077       -9 FALSE          12
#> 4    4  1 4.886266       -8 FALSE          12
#> 5    5  1 7.085950       -7 FALSE          12
#> 6    6  1 5.788352       -6 FALSE          12
```

Or, in graph form.

## Test the package

Remember to load the package (if you haven't already).

```r
library(did2s)
```

Let's try the basic `did2s()` command on our fake dataset. We'll start by
estimating a simple binary treatment effect, rather than a full event-study.
There are some things that I want to draw your attention to w.r.t. our first-
and second-stage regression arguments below. The `first_stage` formula uses `|`
to demarcate regular covariates (although theren't any in this dataset) from the
fixed-effects slot. The `second_stage` formula invokes the `i()` operator to
create an indicator (factor) of our "treat" variable. Both of these syntax
features should be familiar to **fixest** users, but are worth underscoring all
the same. 

```r
did2s(
  data         = dat,
  yname        = "y", 
  first_stage  = ~ 0 | id + time, # 0 b/c we have no controls in this dataset
  second_stage = ~ i(treat),      # binary treatment dummy (not an event-study) 
  treatment    = "treat",
  cluster_var  = "id",
  )

#' Running Two-stage Difference-in-Differences
#' • first stage formula `~ 0 | id + time`
#' • second stage formula `~ i(treat)`
#' • The indicator variable that denotes when treatment is on is `treat`
#' • Standard errors will be clustered by `id`
#' OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: y
#' Observations: 1,800 
#' Standard-errors: Custom 
#'                   Estimate   Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)    
#' treat::FALSE -5.010000e-15 1.070000e-15 -4.69674 2.844e-06 ***
#' treat::TRUE   1.399854e+02 1.216437e+01 11.50782 < 2.2e-16 ***
#' ---
#' Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
#' RMSE: 80.9   Adj. R2: 0.425782
```

Okay, now let's try a more realistic use-case by estimating a full event-study. 
The only change we need to make _vis-à-vis_ the previous regression is in the 
`second_stage` formula. This time, we'll use a relative time variable (AKA
time-to-treatment) rather than a binary treatment indicator. Note that I'm
specifying two reference periods via `i(rel_time, ref = c(-1, Inf))`. The first
(`-1`) sets all effects relative to the period immediately before treatment. The
second (`Inf`) establishes the "never-treated" control group for this dataset;
this reference value may differ for your own data. I'll also go ahead and save
the resulting model object, since I plan to graph the corresponding event-study
plot below.

```r
es_mod = did2s(
  data         = dat,
  yname        = "y",
  first_stage  = ~ 0 | id + time,
  second_stage = ~ i(rel_time, ref = -c(1, Inf)), # Use relative time var. for event-study
  treatment    = "treat",
  cluster_var  = "id"
  )

#' Running Two-stage Difference-in-Differences
#' • first stage formula `~ 0 | id + time`
#' • second stage formula `~ i(rel_time, ref = -c(1, Inf))`
#' • The indicator variable that denotes when treatment is on is `treat`
#' • Standard errors will be clustered by `id`

#' RMSE: 25.7   Adj. R2: 0.939163
```

As I keep emphasizing, **did2s** is using **fixest** underneath the hood and all
of the latter methods apply. So we plot our event-study model using
[`fixest::iplot()`](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/coefplot.html#iplot-1). 

```r
# fixest::iplot(es_mod) 
# Vanilla option (above) is fine, but we can tweak a bit...
es_mod |>
  fixest::iplot(
    main     = "did2s",
    xlab     = "Time to treatment",
    drop     = "[[:digit:]]{2}",    # Drop any leads/lags greater than |9|
    ref.line = 1
  )
```

## Introduction

The *sdid* command is written by [Damian Clarke](https://www.damianclarke.net/) and [Daniel PailaÃ±ir](https://daniel-pailanir.github.io/) based on the Arkhangelsky et. al. 2021 paper [Synthetic Difference-in-Differences](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190159). A detailed description is provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/Daniel-Pailanir/sdid).

## Installation and options

```stata
ssc install sdid, replace
```

Take a look at the help file:

```stata
help sdid
```

## Test the command

Please make sure that you generate the data using the script given [here](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/DiD/docs/code/06_03_data/) 

```stata
sdid Y id t D, vce(bootstrap) seed(1000) 
```

Since we are using bootstrapped standard errors, we fix the seed for replicability. We get this output:


```stata
Bootstrap replications (50). This may take some time.

95% CIs and p-values are based on Large-Sample approximations.

```

The command also has a built in graph option:

```applescript
sdid Y id year D, vce(bootstrap) seed(1000) graph
```


The command saves a set of graphs with prefix `g2_` that represent synthetic DiD graphs split by the year of the first treatment:

The weights used to average pre-treatment periods are shown as area fills at the bottom of the figures.
